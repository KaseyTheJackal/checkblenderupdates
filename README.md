# checkblenderupdates
A script plus a cron-job that checks for daily Blender experimental builds every hour and displays a notification letting the user know if there's a new experimental release


# TODO
Make the script automatically download, mount, and install, the new version of Blender


# Getting started
1. A Mac, or hackintosh. Linux support will come later. 
2. Run `pip3 install selenium`, wait for it to install
3. You should be good to go
