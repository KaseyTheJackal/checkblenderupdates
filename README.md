# checkblenderupdates
A script plus a launchd daemon that checks for daily Blender experimental builds every day and displays a notification letting the user know if there's a new experimental release

# Getting started
1. A Mac, or hackintosh. Linux support will come later.
2. Run install.app, type your password, wait a minute or two
3. You should be good to go


# If you find the script useful, consider supporting my caffine habit!
